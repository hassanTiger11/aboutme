# Why Saudia Airlines Have To Rethink Thier Entertainement System
Saudia Airlines is the main lines I have been using to go back and forth between the US and Saudi Arabia. Through the years I have never been on the bussiness class up until I learned how to use my miles effeciently. Fortunately, this time I had a free upgrade to the world of rich people and how they fly. The service is phenominal, the best food you might ever imagine, seats are just uh please take me back. Nevertheless, there was one thing that has irritated me throughout the whole trip, it was the entertainment service on the bussiness class. Although each seat has a HUGE screen and enough space, they have inappropritaely replaced a touch screen controller in place of the regular buttoned controller that they have in the economy class. Although eveyone is always psyched by the sound of new technolgy and touch screens, they only make sense if they fit the problem. 

In the case of Saudia Airlines I feel like they didn't know how to make their entertainement system fancier and thought that a touch screen would magically put them ahead in the game. Only they forgot the simple principles of engineering and how to think solutions to actual problems. Looking at this new integration, it could be a good one but they should rethink how they do it. To give an idea for a similar problem, look at the controller of a TV, it doesn't need to be a touch screen, or look at the controller of a Playstation/Xbox, they have actual clickable/mechanical parts that are easier to use by the user. In their case Saduia Airlines should have thought of designiing.

Well, now let's unpack what was wrong with their system.

To begin with, let's talk about what I felt when I first picked the controller. As soon as I picked the controller, I saw the same screen squeezed into smaller area with many buttons on top of each other. All they did is replicate eveything twice with a worse quality on the smaller screen (the controller). As of this we can notice they didn't think of (somthing's principle) ***. As a user I don't want to look at the same things twice nor do I want to experience an uglier version of the more beautiful version that was already available to me. The latter just gave a negative contrast effect that the UI engineers only played around with the CSS.

## Structure of This Article:
- Everything is replicated twice 
                                -> waste of engineering time trying to fit the same system on two screens
                                -> as a user I don't want to look at the same things twice
                                -> Things look ugly squeezed into a small screen compared to the big screen -> Not a really good adaptation
- The system feels like two separate system that don't fit into one 
                                -> The Main goal of the controller is to control whatever is on monitor. 
                                -> As a user I would enjoy looking directly into the HD screen and not focus on the smaller controller


- The video control screen is really ugly 
                                -> The UI team is trying to fit the movie's name & poster, the movie's timeline slider, the system volume, and the system's brightness. From the former list we can notice that we have two main objects, the movie being played and the overall system. This screen would be way prettier if the controller had physical buttons to control some of the system's preferences like volume and broghtness.
- Using a touch screen for a simple design is a waste of money and engineering power.
                                -> The touch sensors are really awful on the controller. 
                                -> Touch screens are fancier option but they will only be fancier if they were used appropriately. Trying to fit the same UI on a very responsive touch screen and on a less responsive touch screen is impossible. In the latter the area of detection of touch is bigger and bigger buttons should be fir on it. It was really hard to use the buttons and controllers. Hypothetically if we want to fit the same UI with the same amount of control options on a smaller screen we have to take into consideration the was that we will show them. 

                                ->It would cost less if we just plug in a regular buttoned controller

- How I would rethink the system:
                                -> I think that the monitor is really beautiful and it shold be kept the way it is. Only thing they should do is bring the economy class controllers into the recipe. Integrating new technology into the system should be studies both from a hardware perspective and software perspective. In the case of Saudia Airlines it feels like they recycled their software, played a bit with the CSS and connected both screens with a cord. The old hardware (the hardware in lesser classes) is way better because it fits the problem. The regular clickable buttoned controller is cheaper, easier to use and doesn't require an extra team of software engineers who on their way to create a feature created a huge bug in the system.
    ### What if they don't want to replace the touch screens?
                                -> I recommend that we simplify the controller UI
                                * Screen 1 -> when observing the movies list, the games list, the book list, the audio list

# What they should add after redesiging the system?
                                -> Movie rating feature.
